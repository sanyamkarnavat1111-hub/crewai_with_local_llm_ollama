# Agent: A worker with a role (e.g., "Researcher"), goal (e.g., "Find reliable info"), backstory (for context), and an LLM (Ollama).
# Task: A job description, expected output, and assigned agent. Tasks can delegate or use tools.
# Crew: A team of agents + tasks. You choose a process (e.g., sequential: one after another).
# Tools: Optional add-ons like web search. Agents decide when to use them.



# While running the code
- No need to do "ollama serve" this breaks the operation
